# Trivia app

## React app with Rails Back End

This is a React application with which you can practice your skills playing trivia games. Persistence of score is handled via Rails backend. Async actions are used to send data to and receive data from a server and external API. I use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change.

## Install instructions

Run `rake db:migrate`, `rake db:seed` to seed the database. Then run `rake start` and click on a link provided in your terminal.
